# CLASS 03

- lecture took 40 minutes
- most students on questions 12-13 of the lab
- some confusion about where fixed vs. variable aes
values go; somewhat okay though as got people thinking
and not just copying
- a few typos in lab need to be fixed

# CLASS 04

- notes took about 35 minutes
- not a lot of confusion generally
- some students have not been keeping up with the labs
