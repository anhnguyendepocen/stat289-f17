### About me

I am an \magenta{applied statistician}. A sampling of projects and datasets
I have worked on include:

- cell phone telemetry
- emergency room patient flow
- finding holes in specialized medical coverage in rural US
- Canadian court case citations
- Olympic figure skating scoring
- auto insurance risk factors
- 170k documentary photographs from the 1930's
- treatment outcomes for open-angle glaucoma
- detecting radicalization from social media data
- financial warfare

# Syllabus

### Computing

The focus of this course will be on applied statistics and data
analysis over symbolic mathematics. To facilitate this, nearly
every class assignment and exam will involve some form of
computing. No prior programming experience is assumed or
required.

### R and RStudio

We will use the **R** programming environment throughout the
semester. It is freely available for all major operating systems and
is pre-installed on many campus computers.

### Computers

\orange{I strongly recommend using your own machine for this course}.
The lab computers will be available as well, though I find them to be
quite slow and poorly maintained. We will devote a substantial
amount of the time learning how to work within the R programming
framework.

\pause **Please bring your laptop to our next class meeting!**

### References

There is no required textbook for the course, but we will pull
from a number of sources for material.

### Course Website

All of the materials and assignments for the course will be posted
on the class website:

> [https://statsmaths.github.io/stat289](https://statsmaths.github.io/stat289)

### GitHub

All of your work for this semester will be submitted through GitHub,
the same platform that hosts our website. You'll need to set up a free
account, which we will cover during our next class.

### Grades

All grades in this course will be given on as a letter grade.
While occasionally possible to receive pluses / minuses or
fractional points, these will usually be given a whole letter grade.

### Grade Breakdown

There are three components to your final grade:

- Labs, 10%
- Participation, 10%
- Data Reports, 80%


### Lab and Participation Grades

I expect most students to get full marks (A) for labs and participation.
Students found to be delinquent in either will first receive a written
warning, followed by an initial 50% reduction (C) in the respective grade,
and finally a 100% reduction (F).

### Final Grade

I want to make the grading extremely transparent, so your final grade will
simply consist of taking your weighted numerical average using the following
conversions:

- A: 4
- B: 3
- C: 2
- D: 1
- F: 0

And looking up your grade (rounded to the second digit)
on the table provided in the syllabus.

### Labs

Most class meetings, particularly in the first half of the semester,
will have an interactive lab associated with it. These consist of a
set of questions that must be answered with either small snippets of
code or short descriptive answers. Your solutions must be uploaded
to your GitHub page.

### Data Reports

Data reports are short written documents that mix code, graphics,
and prose to provide a comprehensive analysis of a data set.
We will have a data report due approximately bi-weekly. These must
also be uploaded to GitHub. The format for these reports will be
described in the first two weeks of the course.

### Exams

This course has no exams, final or otherwise.

### Attendance and Late Policy

You are expected to submit work on-time.

You should aim to attend all class meetings.

However I am fully aware that through the course of the semester various issues
-- illness, sports, and family emergencies --
will prevent many of you from attending every class.

Please be respectful of my time, keep my informed of any
issues as early as possible, and come prepared to most
meetings of the course.
