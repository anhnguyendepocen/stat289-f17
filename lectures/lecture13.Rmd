## regression inference

We have seen how to use the `lm_basic` function to fit models for the
mean of some response. We have used both a single mean for the entire
dataset as well as multiple means based on a second categorical variable.
What happens if we use the same set-up but instead use a numeric variable
to predict the value of some response? The output is surprisingly similar,
but the interpretation of the results differ slightly.

## regression inference

As an example, let's predict the amount each mammal is awake as a function
of how many hours it has of rem sleep:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm_basic(awake ~ 1 + sleep_rem, data = msleep)
reg_table(model, level = 0.95)
```

## regression inference

\footnotesize

```{r, eval = TRUE}
model <- lm_basic(awake ~ 1 + sleep_rem, data = msleep)
reg_table(model, level = 0.95)
```

## regression inference

There is once again an intercept term and a row of the table corresponding
to the new variable `sleep_rem`. What do these numbers mean? It turns out
that this is simply describing a best-fit line through the data. We have
already seen how to do this graphically with `geom_smooth`. The line here
is, exactly, the line given in this plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(sleep_rem, awake, data = msleep) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## regression inference

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
qplot(sleep_rem, awake, data = msleep) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## regression inference

The `reg_table` function is just giving us the intercept and slope of
this line, along with confidence interval bounds for both.

## multiple variables

Further, and finally, we can add multiple variables into a single regression.
It is even possible to mix continuous and categorical variables into the
same model:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm_basic(awake ~ 1 + sleep_rem + vore, data = msleep)
reg_table(model, level = 0.95)
```

## multiple variables

\footnotesize

```{r, eval = TRUE}
model <- lm_basic(awake ~ 1 + sleep_rem + vore, data = msleep)
reg_table(model, level = 0.95)
```

## multiple variables

The interpretation becomes, in this case, the change we would expect to
see in the response given a *marginal* change in one of the explanatory
variables on the right-hand side of the model. That is, how do we expect
the mean to change if we modify one (and only one) of the other variables.
