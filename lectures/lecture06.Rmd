## Data Types

We have already discussed that variables in R
have different *data types*, most likely one of the following:

* `int` stands for integers.
* `dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.
* `chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

## Example

\small

An example with the mammals sleep data:

```{r}
data(msleep)
msleep
```

## Example

The names and genus are characters whereas numbers such as `awake`
are doubles. These slides shows how to convert numeric variables
into categorical ones and way to manipulate categorical variables.
There is generally no straightforward way to convert a categorical
variable into a number, so we will not discuss that here.

# Numeric to Categorical

## With factor()

To convert every unique values of a numeric variable to a category
in a new categorical variable, we simply use the function `factor`.
For example, we can convert `sleep_rem` into categories. This changes,
amongst other things, the way color is used in a plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = factor(sleep_rem))
```

Notice that missing values became there own category. This is often
very useful.

## With factor()

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = factor(sleep_rem))
```

## With cut() and bin()

Often we do not want each numeric variable to be its own category but
instead wish to group values that are close into a single category.
There are two related functions for doing this: `cut` and `bin`. Both
take the variable followed by the number of bins to use. The function
`cut` splits the range of the variable into equally spaced buckets
where as `bin` breaks the range up so that each bin has (roughly) the
same proportion of data points.

For most variables the difference between these two functions is small;
I usually use `cut` because the interval cutoffs print out nicer. However,
when a variable is fairly skewed, I find that `bin` works better.

## With cut() and bin()

For example, notice how different cutting and binning the `brainwt`
variable is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = cut(brainwt, 5))
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = bin(brainwt, 5))
```

This variable is very skewed and the cutting algorithm puts almost all of
the mammals in the same category.

## brainwt with cut()

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = cut(brainwt, 5))
```

## brainwt with bin()

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(vore, awake, data = msleep,
        color = bin(brainwt, 5))
```

# Manipulating Categorical Data

## concept

Likewise, it is sometimes useful to convert one categorical variable into
another categorical variable by grouping or ordering the categories in a
different way. To work with these, we will use the **forcats** package:

```{r}
library(forcats)
```

By default categories are order alphabetically.

## fct_infreq

The function `fct_infreq` order the categories from largest
to smallest.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(fct_infreq(vore), data = msleep)
```

## fct_infreq

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(fct_infreq(vore, 2), data = msleep)
```

## fct_lump

The function `fct_lump` take a second argument that gives the maximum
number of categories allowed. The most frequent categories are included
and all other categories are lumped into the `other` category.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(vore, data = msleep)
qplot(fct_lump(vore, 2), data = msleep)
```

## fct_lump

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(vore, data = msleep)
```

## fct_lump

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(fct_lump(vore, 2), data = msleep)
```

## fct_relevel

Finally, the function `fct_relevel` takes multiple arguments
that gives the categories that should be first, second, and
so on. Unmentioned categories are left in their original
order:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(fct_relevel(vore, "omni", "insecti"),
        data = msleep)
```

## fct_relevel

```{r, eval = TRUE}
qplot(fct_relevel(vore, "omni", "insecti"),
        data = msleep)
```

# Plot Labels

## Axes

All this messing with the input variables makes the default
axis labels become quite messy. To modify these, simply add
the functions `xlab()` and/or `ylab()` to the plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(fct_relevel(vore, "omni", "insecti"), awake,
        data = msleep) + xlab("Diet Type") +
        ylab("Hours Awake")
```

## Axes

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fct_relevel(vore, "omni", "insecti"), awake,
        data = msleep) + xlab("Diet Type") +
        ylab("Hours Awake")
```

## Titles

Similarly, titles are added with `ggtitle()` and
labels for legends with the `labs()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(sleep_rem, awake, color = vore, data = msleep) +
    ggtitle("An Awesome Plot") +
    labs(color = "Diet Type") +
    xlab("Hours REM Sleep") +
    ylab("Hours Awake")
```

## Titles

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
qplot(sleep_rem, awake, color = vore, data = msleep) +
    ggtitle("An Awesome Plot") +
    labs(color = "Diet Type") +
    xlab("Hours REM Sleep") +
    ylab("Hours Awake")
```
