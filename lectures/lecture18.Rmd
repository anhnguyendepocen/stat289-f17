## basic string manipulation

Today we will cover the main aspects of working with raw
strings in R using the **stringi** package. To load
the package call:
```{r}
library(stringi)
```
## stringi

The main advantages of this package over this package compared
to those in base-R are:

* consistent syntax - the string you are operating on is always
the first element and functions all start with `stri_`
* great support for non-latin character sets and proper UTF-8
handling
* in some cases much faster than alternatives

## stringi

We will work with two datasets that come pre-installed with
**stringr** (a wrapper around **stringi**), a list of common
English tokens named `words` and a list of short sentences
named `sentences`. We will wrap these up as data frames in
order to make them usable by the **dplyr** verbs we have
been learning:

```{r}
df_words <- data_frame(words = stringr::words)
df_sent <- data_frame(sent = stringr::sentences)
```

## stri_sub

The first function we will look at is `stri_sub` that takes
a substring of each input by position; for example the following
finds the first three characters of every string in the data
set of words:

```{r}
mutate(df_words, chars = stri_sub(words, 1, 3))
```

## stri_sub

Notice that R silently ignores the fact that the first word
that has only one letter (it is returned as-is).
We can use negative values to begin at the end of the string
(-1 is the last character, -2 the second to last and so on).
So the last two characters can be grabbed with this:

```{r}
mutate(df_words, chars = stri_sub(words, -2, -1))
```

## stri_length

The function `stri_length` describes how many characters are
in a string:

```{r}
mutate(df_words, num_char = stri_length(words))
```

## stri_trans_toupper

And the functions `stri_trans_toupper` and `stri_trans_tolower` do exactly
as they describe:

```{r}
mutate(df_words, up = stri_trans_toupper(words), down = stri_trans_tolower(words))
```

## stri_trans_totitle

We even have `stri_trans_totitle` to convert to title case:

```{r}
stri_trans_totitle("The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks.")
```

# matching fixed strings

## stri_detect

A function that finds patterns is the function
`stri_detect`, which returns either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
for whether an element has a string withing in. We
can use this conjunction with the `filter` command
to find examples with a particular string in it:

```{r}
filter(df_sent, stri_detect(sent, fixed = "hand"))
```

## stri_count

Similarly `stri_count` tells us how often a sentence
uses a particular string. For instance, how many times
are the digraphs "th", "ch", and "sh" used in each
sentence:

```{r}
temp <-
mutate(df_sent, th = stri_count(sent, fixed = "th"),
                sh = stri_count(sent, fixed = "sh"),
                ch = stri_count(sent, fixed = "ch"),
                sent = stri_sub(sent, 1, 20))
```

I took a substring of the first column to make it fit on
the page.

## stri_count

```{r}
temp
```

## stri_replace_all

The function `stri_replace_all` replaces one pattern with
another. Perhaps we want to replace all of those borning
"e"'s with "ë":

```{r}
mutate(df_sent, sent = stri_replace_all(sent, "ë", fixed = "e"))
```

## stri_replace

The function `stri_replace` without the "all" only replaces
the first occurrence in each string.

# matching patterns

## patterns

Trying to use the previous functions with a fixed string
can be useful, but the true strength of these functions
come from their ability to accept a pattern known as a
regular expression.

We don't have time to cover these in great detail, but
will show a few important examples. The first example we
will us is the "." symbol which matches any character.

## patterns

So, for instance the following finds any time that we have
the letters "w" and "s" separated by any third character.
Can you find where this occurs in each line?

```{r}
filter(df_sent, stri_detect(sent, regex = "w.s"))
```

## anchors

Two other special characters are "^" and "$",
called *anchors*. The first matches  the start of a
sentence and the second matches the end of a sentence. So, which words
end with the letter "w"?

```{r}
filter(df_words, stri_detect(words, regex = "w$"))
```

## anchors

Or start with "sh"?

```{r}
filter(df_words, stri_detect(words, regex = "^sh"))
```

## stri_extract

There is on other **stringi** function we did not mention
earlier: `stri_extract`. Given a pattern it returns the
string that matches it. This is not very useful without
regular expression but with them is an invaluable tool.

## stri_extract

For example, what characters follow the pattern "th"?

```{r}
temp <- mutate(df_sent, triple = stri_extract(sent, regex = "th."))
count(temp, triple, sort = TRUE)
```

## HTML tags

There are many other more complex regular expressions. For
example, this one is very useful:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stri_replace(html, " ", regex = "<[^>]+>")
```

If `html` is a string, this will replace all of the characters
in html tags with a single space. We will use that in our lab
today.
