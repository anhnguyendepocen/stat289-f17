## Advanced summarizing

I wrote the function `group_summarize` because I found that students
struggled using the raw summarizing commands early in the semester.

You may find that you need to do some time of summarization that we did
not cover, so here are some notes on how to do it.

## group_by

We have to use the function `group_by` and the function summarize on the
dataset. The first tells R which variables to summarize by, but the second
tells it which new variables to create:

```{r}
summarize(group_by(bikes, season),
          min_temp = min(temp), max_temp = max(temp))
```

## summarize

Each of the new variables, however, must be described
explicitly. Here we are able to compute the minimum and maximum

## grouped mutate

Group by can also be combined with the `mutate` function to append summary
statistics to a group of variables. For example, if we wanted to add
the average temperature of each season to every row of the dataset, we
would do this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mutate(group_by(bikes, season), avg_temp = mean(temp))
```

## grouped top_n

The `top_n` function that we saw last time can also be used with the
`group_by` function. Here we find the hottest day in each season:

```{r}
top_n(group_by(bikes, season), n = 1, temp)
```
