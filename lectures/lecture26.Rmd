## qplot

When we first saw plots in this course, I introduced the `qplot`
function. It takes an x-coordinate, option y-coordinate, and
dataset. From these, it determines the best type of plot to
create. Later I showed how to add additional layers onto the
plot and even how to turn off the original default.

## qqplot

The Q in `qplot` stands for "quick" because (as you saw), it can
used with a very minimal amount of understanding about the
**ggplot2** package.

Today I'll show you how to build plots without `qplot`. Given
everything we know already, this will be quite easy.

## ggplot

The `ggplot` function serves to create a new, empty graphic.
The following would create a completely empty plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot()
```

## ggplot

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot()
```

## ggplot: data

Next, the first argument to `ggplot` is to dataset name that
we want to work with.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(msleep)
```

On its own this will still construct just an empty plot, however
it now has a dataset (invisibly) attached to it.

## ggplot: aesthetics

The next step is to assigned the aesthetics to the plot. These
should be familiar to us, and consist of things like `x`, `y`,
`color`, and `label`. We cannot give these directly however;
they need to be wrapped in the `aes` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = awake, y = sleep_rem, color = vore))
```

Again, nothing will happen yet, but we have made invisible
changes to the graphic.

## ggplot: layers

The rest we actually already know; we need to add layers such
as `geom_point`, `geom_line`, and `geom_text` to this base plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = awake, y = sleep_rem, color = vore)) +
    geom_point()
```

## ggplot: layers

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = awake, y = sleep_rem), color = "red") +
    geom_point()
```

## ggplot: why?

One reason for learning this new calling structure is that you'll
find many code snippets online that use it. Searching for help with
**ggplot2** will more likely than not lead to StackOverflow or other
resources that assume you are familiar with it.

The second reason is that the `aes()` calling mechanism is actually
accepted by all of the `geom_` layers. This allows us to plot multiple
facets at once.

## ggplot: example

Here, we color the points by the vore variable but fit just a
single line to the plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = awake, y = sleep_rem)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = vore)) +
    geom_smooth()
```

## ggplot: example

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(x = awake, y = sleep_rem)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = vore)) +
    geom_smooth()
```
