# Today, your goal is to construct a dataset as described in the class
# notes and to apply this to answering the following three questions using the
# functions we learned today:
#
#  - what is your prediction for the actual average population of
#    all 150 of the most populous US cities (this was a random sample
#    from these 150 cities)
#
#  - test the hypothesis that the ratio between your guess and the
#    actual population is equal to 1* (you'll need to make a new variable
#    in R)
#
#  - test whether the ratio between your guess and the actual
#    population are different based on which coast the city is on
#    (you'll probably need `filter` here)
#
#  - fit a regression model between the actual city population and
#    the ratio between your guess and the city population. do you tend to
#    do better predicting small or larger cities?
#
# I'll leave it to you as to exactly how to do the latter. Please upload your
# csv file to GitHub in addition to your code.
