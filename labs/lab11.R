# 01.  For practice, please create another dataset of your choosing. For this
# lab, please upload this lab file as well as the dataset to GitHub.

# I am open to anything you would enjoy constructing a small dataset with;
# the only rule is that you need at least two separate tables, each with
# at least 5 observations. One table should have some numeric data in it.

# Here are some examples of the primary table that you could create. For
# the secondary table, consider mapping the state or country code to a
# table describing the state or country (full name; region / continent, ect.)

# 1. Your favorite restaurants; record the name of the restaurant, the style
#    of restaurant, the price of a typical meal, average length of time spent
#    there in minutes

# 2. A dataset of your closest friends; give their name, where you met, their
#    approximate height in inches, how long you've known them for in years

# 3. Ten styles of beer; give the name, county of origin, typical ABV, and
#    how much you like it on a ten-point scale

# 4. A set of your favorite music artists/bands; write the name of the group,
#    the genre, the number of albums they have, the number of years they are/
#    were active, and where they started

# Note: We are just doing this for illustration purposes, so don't obsess
# about having to guess some values. Just fill in something reasonable.

# 02. Export your dataset as csv files (one for each table) and name them
# "data_01.csv", "data_02.csv", and so on. Save the files on GitHub

# MAKE SURE YOU *ALSO* UPLOAD THIS FILE, OR YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE CREDIT FOR
# THE ASSIGNMENT!
