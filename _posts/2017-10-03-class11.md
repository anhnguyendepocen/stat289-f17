## Goal

We are going to start today by having you all open either
excel, open office, Google sheets, or the spreadsheet editor
of your choice.

You will be constructing a dataset representing your five
favorite films.

## data elements

Please collect the following (I suggest starting with Wikipedia):

- name of the movie
- movie budget
- country of origin
- date first released
- staring actors (truncate to top 3 if too many)
- birthplace of each actor
- rotten tomatoes rating of the movie

## csv and reading into R

Once you are done with this, export the file as a CSV to your
computer and read this into R. Time remaining, try to construct
some interesting plots.

# data collection principals

## three principles

All of the principles of constructing a dataset (equivalently, a
database) could easily fill a whole course. Here are three principles
that get us on the right track:

- determine the objects of study; each of these gets its own table,
and each example gets its own row; **movies**, **actors**,
**actor-movie links**
- each column should be indivisible and the variable type clear;
for example, budget should not include the dollar sign, if needed
create a new column; name columns with no spaces or special characters
- always have internal consistency (0.62 or 62 percent; missing
values always "NA"); strive for external consistency (ISO country
codes)
