## basic string manipulation

Today we will cover the main aspects of working with raw
strings in R using the **stringi** package. To load
the package call:


{% highlight r %}
library(stringi)
{% endhighlight %}
## stringi

The main advantages of this package over this package compared
to those in base-R are:

* consistent syntax - the string you are operating on is always
the first element and functions all start with `stri_`
* great support for non-latin character sets and proper UTF-8
handling
* in some cases much faster than alternatives

## stringi

We will work with two datasets that come pre-installed with
**stringr** (a wrapper around **stringi**), a list of common
English tokens named `words` and a list of short sentences
named `sentences`. We will wrap these up as data frames in
order to make them usable by the **dplyr** verbs we have
been learning:


{% highlight r %}
df_words <- data_frame(words = stringr::words)
df_sent <- data_frame(sent = stringr::sentences)
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_sub

The first function we will look at is `stri_sub` that takes
a substring of each input by position; for example the following
finds the first three characters of every string in the data
set of words:


{% highlight r %}
mutate(df_words, chars = stri_sub(words, 1, 3))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 980 x 2
##       words chars
##       <chr> <chr>
##  1        a     a
##  2     able   abl
##  3    about   abo
##  4 absolute   abs
##  5   accept   acc
##  6  account   acc
##  7  achieve   ach
##  8   across   acr
##  9      act   act
## 10   active   act
## # ... with 970 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_sub

Notice that R silently ignores the fact that the first word
that has only one letter (it is returned as-is).
We can use negative values to begin at the end of the string
(-1 is the last character, -2 the second to last and so on).
So the last two characters can be grabbed with this:


{% highlight r %}
mutate(df_words, chars = stri_sub(words, -2, -1))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 980 x 2
##       words chars
##       <chr> <chr>
##  1        a     a
##  2     able    le
##  3    about    ut
##  4 absolute    te
##  5   accept    pt
##  6  account    nt
##  7  achieve    ve
##  8   across    ss
##  9      act    ct
## 10   active    ve
## # ... with 970 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_length

The function `stri_length` describes how many characters are
in a string:


{% highlight r %}
mutate(df_words, num_char = stri_length(words))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 980 x 2
##       words num_char
##       <chr>    <int>
##  1        a        1
##  2     able        4
##  3    about        5
##  4 absolute        8
##  5   accept        6
##  6  account        7
##  7  achieve        7
##  8   across        6
##  9      act        3
## 10   active        6
## # ... with 970 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_trans_toupper

And the functions `stri_trans_toupper` and `stri_trans_tolower` do exactly
as they describe:


{% highlight r %}
mutate(df_words, up = stri_trans_toupper(words), down = stri_trans_tolower(words))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 980 x 3
##       words       up     down
##       <chr>    <chr>    <chr>
##  1        a        A        a
##  2     able     ABLE     able
##  3    about    ABOUT    about
##  4 absolute ABSOLUTE absolute
##  5   accept   ACCEPT   accept
##  6  account  ACCOUNT  account
##  7  achieve  ACHIEVE  achieve
##  8   across   ACROSS   across
##  9      act      ACT      act
## 10   active   ACTIVE   active
## # ... with 970 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_trans_totitle

We even have `stri_trans_totitle` to convert to title case:


{% highlight r %}
stri_trans_totitle("The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks.")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "The Birch Canoe Slid On The Smooth Planks."
{% endhighlight %}

# matching fixed strings

## stri_detect

A function that finds patterns is the function
`stri_detect`, which returns either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
for whether an element has a string withing in. We
can use this conjunction with the `filter` command
to find examples with a particular string in it:


{% highlight r %}
filter(df_sent, stri_detect(sent, fixed = "hand"))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 4 x 1
##                                       sent
##                                      <chr>
## 1 Weave the carpet on the right hand side.
## 2 Hedge apples may stain your hands green.
## 3    Shake hands with this friendly child.
## 4        Many hands help get the job done.
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_count

Similarly `stri_count` tells us how often a sentence
uses a particular string. For instance, how many times
are the digraphs "th", "ch", and "sh" used in each
sentence:


{% highlight r %}
temp <-
mutate(df_sent, th = stri_count(sent, fixed = "th"),
                sh = stri_count(sent, fixed = "sh"),
                ch = stri_count(sent, fixed = "ch"),
                sent = stri_sub(sent, 1, 20))
{% endhighlight %}

I took a substring of the first column to make it fit on
the page.

## stri_count


{% highlight r %}
temp
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 720 x 4
##                    sent    th    sh    ch
##                   <chr> <int> <int> <int>
##  1 The birch canoe slid     2     0     1
##  2 Glue the sheet to th     2     1     0
##  3 It's easy to tell th     2     0     0
##  4 These days a chicken     0     1     1
##  5 Rice is often served     0     0     0
##  6 The juice of lemons      0     0     1
##  7 The box was thrown b     2     0     0
##  8 The hogs were fed ch     0     0     1
##  9 Four hours of steady     0     0     0
## 10 Large size in stocki     0     0     0
## # ... with 710 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_replace_all

The function `stri_replace_all` replaces one pattern with
another. Perhaps we want to replace all of those borning
"e"'s with "ë":


{% highlight r %}
mutate(df_sent, sent = stri_replace_all(sent, "ë", fixed = "e"))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 720 x 1
##                                           sent
##                                          <chr>
##  1  Thë birch canoë slid on thë smooth planks.
##  2 Gluë thë shëët to thë dark bluë background.
##  3      It's ëasy to tëll thë dëpth of a wëll.
##  4    Thësë days a chickën lëg is a rarë dish.
##  5        Ricë is oftën sërvëd in round bowls.
##  6       Thë juicë of lëmons makës finë punch.
##  7 Thë box was thrown bësidë thë parkëd truck.
##  8 Thë hogs wërë fëd choppëd corn and garbagë.
##  9         Four hours of stëady work facëd us.
## 10    Largë sizë in stockings is hard to sëll.
## # ... with 710 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_replace

The function `stri_replace` without the "all" only replaces
the first occurrence in each string.

# matching patterns

## patterns

Trying to use the previous functions with a fixed string
can be useful, but the true strength of these functions
come from their ability to accept a pattern known as a
regular expression.

We don't have time to cover these in great detail, but
will show a few important examples. The first example we
will us is the "." symbol which matches any character.

## patterns

So, for instance the following finds any time that we have
the letters "w" and "s" separated by any third character.
Can you find where this occurs in each line?


{% highlight r %}
filter(df_sent, stri_detect(sent, regex = "w.s"))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 81 x 1
##                                             sent
##                                            <chr>
##  1          Rice is often served in round bowls.
##  2   The box was thrown beside the parked truck.
##  3          The boy was there when the sun rose.
##  4 The fish twisted and turned on the bent hook.
##  5       The swan dive was far short of perfect.
##  6 The beauty of the view stunned the young boy.
##  7          Her purse was full of useless trash.
##  8   The wrist was badly strained and hung limp.
##  9     The meal was cooked before the bell rang.
## 10    The ship was torn apart on the sharp reef.
## # ... with 71 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

## anchors

Two other special characters are "^" and "$",
called *anchors*. The first matches  the start of a
sentence and the second matches the end of a sentence. So, which words
end with the letter "w"?


{% highlight r %}
filter(df_words, stri_detect(words, regex = "w$"))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 18 x 1
##       words
##       <chr>
##  1    allow
##  2     blow
##  3     draw
##  4      few
##  5   follow
##  6     grow
##  7      how
##  8     know
##  9      law
## 10      low
## 11      new
## 12      now
## 13     show
## 14     slow
## 15    throw
## 16 tomorrow
## 17     view
## 18   window
{% endhighlight %}

## anchors

Or start with "sh"?


{% highlight r %}
filter(df_words, stri_detect(words, regex = "^sh"))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 11 x 1
##     words
##     <chr>
##  1  shall
##  2  share
##  3    she
##  4  sheet
##  5   shoe
##  6  shoot
##  7   shop
##  8  short
##  9 should
## 10   show
## 11   shut
{% endhighlight %}

## stri_extract

There is on other **stringi** function we did not mention
earlier: `stri_extract`. Given a pattern it returns the
string that matches it. This is not very useful without
regular expression but with them is an invaluable tool.

## stri_extract

For example, what characters follow the pattern "th"?


{% highlight r %}
temp <- mutate(df_sent, triple = stri_extract(sent, regex = "th."))
count(temp, triple, sort = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    triple     n
##     <chr> <int>
##  1    the   378
##  2   <NA>   229
##  3    th     47
##  4    tha    23
##  5    thi    20
##  6    thr    12
##  7    tho     6
##  8    th.     3
##  9    thu     1
## 10    thy     1
{% endhighlight %}

## HTML tags

There are many other more complex regular expressions. For
example, this one is very useful:


{% highlight r %}
stri_replace(html, " ", regex = "<[^>]+>")
{% endhighlight %}

If `html` is a string, this will replace all of the characters
in html tags with a single space. We will use that in our lab
today.
