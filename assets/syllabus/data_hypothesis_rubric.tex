{\LARGE Data Analysis Rubric (Hypothesis)}

\vspace*{18pt}

\noindent
\hspace*{24pt} This rubric will be used for grading the second project only. See syllabus for conversion to letter grades. \\
\hspace*{24pt} Getting all `Meets Expectations' yields a grade of $3.5$, a
  a B+/A-. Some categories have values for exceeding. \\
\hspace*{24pt} I may award half-credit for
  work that falls between descriptions.

% Generally getting \\
% \hspace*{24pt}  all Meets Expectations should be a B/B+; only three categories have
% values for exceeding expectations.  \\
% \hspace*{24pt}  scores halfway between two categories.

& Needs Improvement & Meets Expectations & Exceeds Expectations \\
\hline \hline
Hypothesis
  & The hypothesis statement may be vague overly general, or disconnected from the data. \textbf{(0)}
  & A clear hypothesis is given that can be answered with the available data. \textbf{(0.5)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Evidence
  & Support for or against the hypothesis may incorrectly apply statistical concepts to the tasks at hand. \textbf{(0)}
  & Statistical evidence is appropriately used to address the hypothesis statement. Arguments clearly flow from the data and related models and graphics. \textbf{(0.5)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Visualizations \& Models
  & Models, tables, and graphics may not be cohesively woven into the
  argument of the paper nor always appropriately applied. Graphs may
  make poor choices in terms of colors, data types, or fail to include
  proper labels. The command of some methods and theories under
  consideration may be weak or shaky. \textbf{(0)}
  & All models, tables and graphics are appropriately used and
  statistically sound. Graphics are properly labelled and
  visually pleasing. \textbf{(0.5)}
  & \textit{For the exploratory part:} Inventive use of models or graphics. Graphics may contain many
  interwoven layers that increase information density without becoming
  too busy; models may include newly constructed variables or be fit on
  a different level of analysis than the raw data. \textbf{(0.75)} \\ \hline
Organization
  & Some aspects of the paper are not effectively addressed. There may be
  parts of the paper that do not further a distinct or coherent point. \textbf{(0)}
  & There is a logical structure that matches the assignment expectations. Graphics and tables are included at appropriate
  points. \textbf{(0.25)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Exploratory Analysis
  & The exploratory portion of the report may be absent, particularly thin, or not go beyond the initial hypothesis statement\textbf{(0)}
  & The exploratory analysis uses graphics, tables, and/or additional models to find new and unexpected patterns in the data. \textbf{(0.5)}
  & The exploratory analysis shows deep insight into the dataset by drawing
  specific new, non-trivial hypothesis that require a very careful or
  multi-level analysis of the data. Results may be particularly
  surprising or interesting. \textbf{(0.75)} \\ \hline

\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}||p{6cm}|p{6cm}|p{6cm}}
& Needs Improvement & Meets Expectations & Exceeds Expectations \\
\hline \hline
Style
  & Sentence structure tends to be repetitious; errors in usage and
  mechanics sometimes interfere with the writer's ability to communicate the
  purpose of the paper. The tone or intended audience of the piece may be
  inconsistent or not in line with the instructions. \textbf{(0)}
  & The author demonstrates a command of good writing style through a
  variety of sentence structures and word choices. Statistical results are
  woven into the narrative rather than distracting from it. \textbf{(0.25)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Execution
  &  The writing contains errors and omissions that begin to impede on the
  author's ability to make overall arguments. \textbf{(0)}
  & The piece should is almost entirely free of spelling, punctuation, and
  grammatical errors. \textbf{(0.25)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Directions
  & One or more directions in formatting or uploading the piece may not have been followed. \textbf{(0)}
  & All directions are followed and every aspect of the assignment answered in full. \textbf{(0.25)}
  & N/A \\ \hline
Presentation\textsuperscript{*}
  & The presentation may presuppose familiarity with the data at hand or fail
  to make a cohesive argument. The presenter shows a combination of lacking in
  preparation or understanding of the material. \textbf{(0)}
  & The presentation follows a logical structure, makes a compelling argument,
  and is interesting to and appropriate for the classroom audience. The presenter
  has clearly practiced the material and delivers their results confidently. \textbf{(0.5)}
  & N/A \\

\textsuperscript{*} - If the data analysis has no presentation component, this
becomes class participation during the week(s) that we are working on them.
