## Introduction

This file is just a template. Feel free to re-organize and
modify it. You do not need to use these exact sections.

In R-markdown, we write code in special text blocks such
as the following:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data <- read_csv("")
```

The option `echo` determined whether the code is shown as well
as run. In many (perhaps most) cases, you will want to show the code
even though you want to show the output. Change this to `FALSE` in
those cases.

## Conclusions

Use sections headers starting with two pound signs (`##`). If needed,
you can also use subsections (`###`).
