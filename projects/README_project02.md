**Due**: 2017-11-14 (start of class)

This repository serves as starter code for the second project
assignment. Unlike the `.R` files we use in labs, the projects
are done with Rmarkdown files. These have an `.Rmd` extension.
You should also compile them into an html file and the associated
graphics. These must all be uploaded together to the project
website for full credit.

This project is set up to be a private repository. Once submitted,
I will post a markdown file with completed feedback and a filled
in grading rubric.

## Assignment Directions

For this assignment you will work with the dataset that you
have built by grabing links from one or more Wikipedia list
pages. The report should be structured according to the sections
in the template, with the following content:

- Introduction: 1-2 paragraphs about what question you are
studying and a supportable hypothesis statement
- Data collection: describe how you aquired the data and any
post-processing that was done.
- Methods: describe the model or models you are using to test
your hypothesis. This section may be quite brief.
- Results: describe the results of applying the model to your
data and interpret these results in relationship to your
hypothesis. This should take no more than 2-3 paragraphs
- Post-hoc exploration: Here, show any exploratory plots or
additional models that either support, refute, or build off
of your initial model. You may also identify interesting 
patterns that were not initially part of your scope.
- Conclusions: In just a few sentences summarize both your
formal modelling results as well as the results of your
post-hoc exploration of the data.

Note that you do not, and should not, include all of the 
scrapping code in this markdown file. Instead, save the
results of your data collection in a csv file and store it
in this repository.

I do not usually read drafts, but am happy to help with and R
code issues you have or questions about how to create graphics. If
you must be absent on days where we are reviewing thesis statements,
graphics, or drafts, please e-mail me your materials to me before
class.
